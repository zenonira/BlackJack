1. One thing that still doesn't work is if the human gets 21 on the first hand, they do not get tripple their money for winning.
2. One feature that I think is unique is that the buttons dissapear so you can not press them when you are not supposed to. Also, just for fun I put in a small cheat if you get below -$1000.
3. Classes are used to seperate differrent parts of code, making it easier to understand and easier to code.
4. The difference between a private and public variable is that a private variable can not be changed by other classes, while a public variable can.
5. The difference between a class and instance is that an instance is like new hand, or new card, while a class is what each hand or card has.
6. Inheritence are a number of classes, one father the are rest daughter classes. The daughter classes have the same variables as the father, but not each other. This way, you can make seperate classes that are very similar, but are different
7. Super calls upon the constructor, while this calls upon variables in the class
8. State and Behavior
9. Setting up constructors and behaviors in the begining. Once they are set up tough, it is fairly easy.
